# Overview {-}

<img src="images/msc_conv.png" style="width: 200px; float: right;">

<div class="info">
<p>This book contains the materials for students on the MSc Conversion in Psychological Studies/Science. This course is a one-year postgraduate degree where students who already hold a non-psychology undergraduate degree receive a British Psychological Society accredited MSc. The students are typically a diverse cohort and range from those with no STEM or programming background to engineering and computing science graduates. Compared to the undergraduate degree, the students are older, and there is a greater incidence of computer anxiety.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the intense nature of the programme and the diversity of the cohort, the approach to R is slightly different to that taken in the undergraduate programmes. The focus for the MSc is to provide a basic but solid competency in core data skills and statistics that can be built on in further study. Students who wish to push themselves beyond the core competencies are encouraged to consult the MSc Data Skills course where they can learn about e.g., simulation and custom functions. To support those students who may have very limited computer literacy, the beginning stages are more supported than in the undergraduate programme e.g., with an increased use of screenshots and explanations for terminiology.</p>

In RM1 and RM2 you will learn core data skills that allow you to manipulate and analyse quantitative data, a key component of an accredited psychology programme. Each week we will build your skills through pre-class, in-class, and homework activities. In addition to this book, there are video walkthroughs of each in-class activity available on Moodle and there will be drop-in help sessions run by our Graduate Teaching Assistants.

The ability to work with quantitative data is a key skill for psychologists and by using R as our tool we can also promote reproducible research practices. Although it may seem like writing a programming script is more time-consuming than other point-and-click software you may have used, this is not the case! Once you have a script you can easily re-run your analysis without having to go through each step again manually which is a) easier and b) less likely to result in errors if you do something slightly different or forget one of the steps. 

Crucially, with an analysis script other researchers can also see how you got from the raw data to the statistics you report in your final paper. Sharing  analysis scripts online on sites such as the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/) is now seen as an important open science practice. Even if you don't continue with quantitative research in the future, the skills you develop on this course will allow you to evaluate quantitative research and to understand what goes on behind the scenes with data before the conclusions are presented.

## How to use this book

For each R lab for both RM1 and RM2 there will be pre-class and in-class activities. **It is crucial that you attempt the pre-class activities before attending your lab**. You will learn R much more easily if you work on it consistently each week and give yourself time to build and practice your skills. This is so important to your success on this course that your tutor will keep a record of your progress each week. If you are comfortable with R and/or have programming experience, please feel free to work through this book at your own pace and complete more advanced chapters.

## Data files

If you are a student at the University of Glasgow then the relevant data files will be made available on Moodle each week. You can also download them all as a zip file. <a href="all_data.zip" download>Click to Download.</a>

## Intended Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course students will be able to:

* Clean and wrangle data into appropriate forms for analysis
* Visualise data using a range of plots
* Conduct and interpret a core set of statistical tests (chi-square, t-test, correlation, ANOVA, regression)

<div class="info">
<p>All students on the MSc must complete Research Methods 1 (RM1) and Research Methods 2 (RM2) in the first and second semester respectively. These are 10 week, 20 credit courses that cover all aspects of research design and statistics. In RM1, the focus is predominantly on research design and qualitative methods, with only 2 lectures and 3 one-hour labs devoted to R and statistics. By the end of RM1, students should understand descriptive statistics and probability, and as their first inferential test, chi-square. RM2 is soley focused on quanitative methods. In the lectures students cover t-test, correlation, power and effect size, ANOVA, and regression. There are 10 one-hour labs, 5 of which are devoted to a quantitative mini-project, and 5 of which focus on R.</p>
